# CSC-305-Final-Project

Final project involved simulating CPU scheduling algorithms.

Project was written in C.

Emulated algorithms are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN).

Emulated processes are written to a file, which is then read by the compiled program. 

A shell script can also be used, and any of the listed algorithms can be called on a file.
